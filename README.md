# Emacs configuration #

This git repository tracks the `~/.emacs.d/` dir.

Its main purpose is track changes in the `init.el` config file, and theme configuration.

## Instructions ##

1. Clone this repository into your `~/.emacs.d/`
1. When emacs is run, selected packages are auto-installed with `use-package`;
1. Accept permission to use the custom theme:
    1. currently `zerodark-theme`;
    1. The theme hash updates every time you upgrade the theme pkg, so it is not versioned here;
